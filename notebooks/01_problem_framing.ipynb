    "## Problem Context\n",
    "Fraudulent online transactions represent a very small fraction of all transactions, making fraud detection an imbalanced classification problem. A naive model can achieve high accuracy by predicting most transactions as legitimate while failing to detect fraud. This project focuses on building a model that correctly identifies fraudulent transactions using evaluation metrics that reflect performance on the minority class.\n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model that supports automated fraud prevention by identifying high-risk online transactions. The model is designed to automatically block transactions with a high likelihood of fraud while flagging borderline cases for manual review. The primary consumer of the model’s output is an automated fraud prevention system, with secondary use by fraud analysts who review flagged transactions. In this context, false negatives are considered more costly because undetected fraudulent transactions lead to direct financial loss, whereas false positives mainly result in temporary transaction delays and increased operational workload.\n"
